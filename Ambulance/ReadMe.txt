Give me a console game in c#. Like PacMan.
But it should be an ambulande trying to get to a patients in a maze. We steers the ambulance with the arrow keys.
When we get to the patient we get 1 point and a new patient appears and the game continues until we have 10 points.
The bord is constructed as a maze. Everything is on time. Faster is better.

Make the maze 20 by 20 in size. And the start point of ambulance must not be in a wall

Please generate the maze with random walls so we get a new maze each time we start the program.

The ambulace is always starting at position 0,0 and that is in a wall and walls around so we can't move the ambulance. generate a better start position for the ambulance where there is not a wall.
