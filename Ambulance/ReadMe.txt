Give me a console game in C# like PacMan, but it should be an ambulance trying to get to a patient in a maze.
When the ambulace reach the patients position, we get 1 point and a new patient appears at a random position.
The game continues until we have 3 points.
Make the maze 20 by 60 in size.
The start point of the ambulance must not be in a wall or obstacle.
Patient shall not start in obstacle or in a wall.
Generate the maze with random obstacles so we get a new maze each time we start the program.
The ambulance should be indicated with a A in color red.
The patient should be indicated with a P in color green.
The obstacles inside the maze should be indicated with a @ in color grey.
It shall be outer walls of the maze and they should be indicated with a # in color white.
The empty space should be indicated with a space in color black.
The ambulance should be able to move around in the maze with the arrow keys.
The ambulance should not be able to move through walls or obstacles.
The ambulance should not be able to move outside the maze.
The ambulance must be able to reach the patient.
With key escape the game should end.
With key r the game should restart with a new maze.
With key p the game should pause.
With key s the game should start again.
With key h the game should show the help text. And with key h again the help text should disappear. The help text should be in color white.
The help text should be: Var snabb och alert!!!!
Show all keys available in the game.
There shall be no trail of ambulance movement.
The whole console should not be blinking.
