Give me a console game in c#. Like PacMan.
But it should be an ambulande trying to get to a patients in a maze. We steers the ambulance with the arrow keys.
When we get to the patient we get 1 point and a new patient appears and the game continues until we have 10 points.
The bord is constructed as a maze. Everything is on time. Faster is better.
